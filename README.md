# cowbulls
Cowbull game:
an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind. 

I wrote this code from scratch to explore functions, loops and operators within python.

Instructions for game:
If you guess a number correctly but out of place, you get a cow.
If you guess a number ocrrectly in the correct position you get a bull.
FYI once a number has been matched it cannot be matched again i.e 1112 and 0031 only scores 1 cow."

Improvements to follow:
GUI
look to incorporate loop to call match function.
